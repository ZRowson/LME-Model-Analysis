## Introduction

In this model I will attempt to a sample averaged model for the data without modeling the individual tracks of the zebrafish.

## Load Data and Summarize into Means

```{r, load-and-segment}
load("../data/Padilla_DNT60_Loperamide.rda")

data <- copy(Padilla_DNT60_Loperamide)
data.avg <- copy(data)

remove <- data[is.na(y), unique(fishID)]
avg_by_time <- data.avg[!fishID%in%remove & wllq==1, .(meany=mean(y,na.rm=TRUE)), by=.(cpid,conc,t)]


```
